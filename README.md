# NFLDataAggregator
Written By Bailey Strum in January 2017.

This application takes a dataset of Stats from the 2016 NFL season and allows an easy way to view and sort through it.

It also contains all 32 nfl teams and allows the user to look at specific teams and see cool information pertaining to them. 

It uses google api to show where the teams stadium is. More to come when I have more free time (:

Contained in the Contact controller is also code that retrieves the github api and posts your current github name,email,bio, and location to the viewbag and then displays up to date information to the contact page.

Works with the Google Maps API, Google Charts API, and GitHub API to pull data from the web and use it inside the program.

All the scripts and information I used is available for your use. My repository contains filtered data in excel and sql insert scripts for
team data and such. All the code and data is open source and available for your use for whatever you want to do with it. I am not liable
for anything that happens with it.

Thanks,
Bailey Strum
